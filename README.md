Hi there!

This is the place to submit talk proposals for the Open Tech School Learners Meetup Berlin

You can suggest a topic you want to talk about, or a topic you want to hear about by submiting an issue [here](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/learners-meetup-berlin/issues).

Feel free to also submit comments, questions, +1's.

You will need a github account. If you're learning coding - it's a good thing to have!

We recommend talks to not be longer than 20 mins, in the spirit of TED-style talks (because it's hard to concentrate for longer than that).

If you need any help or have any questions, please email 

team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org

Dankesch√∂n!
