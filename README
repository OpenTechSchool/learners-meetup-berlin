Hi there!

This is the place to submit talk proposals for the [Open Tech School Beginners Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ots-beginners-meetup)

You can suggest a topic you want to talk about, or a topic you want to hear about.

Please submit your proposal [here](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/beginners-meetup/issues).

Feel free to also submit comments, questions, +1's.

You will need a github account. If you're learning coding - it's a good thing to have!

We recommend talks to not be longer than 20 mins, in the spirit of TED-style talks (because it's hard to concentrate for longer than that).
